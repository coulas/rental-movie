This is a code base from the book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"
by William Opdyke; Kent Beck; Don Roberts; Martin Fowler; John Brant
Published by Addison-Wesley Professional, 1999.

It is used across the book as example of a code base to improve.
We will use it as a starter to get to know you : your taste, your habits and your opinion on how this code base could be improved.
The book have an opiniated answerbut it does not hold the only truth (even if, well, they are right).
All people running this exercise will end up with a different result according to what's more important to improve.
So remember that there is no best answer, and most are good.
We prefer one that looks like you. 
If you want the most studyed answer and probably the most complete answer, yes, you should buy and read this great book !

Have fun, trying to imporve this code base !
